# Get Some Digits

To complete this challenge, you will need to **obtain a programmable, Twilio-powered phone number**. Phone numbers can be found and purchased in [your Twilio console](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming). You may have already purchased your first number if you just signed up for a Twilio account.

Once you have secured a phone number, enter it in [E.164 format](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164) on the right. The validator will be very picky about this format, so use it exactly! For example, the US phone number "(651) 867-5309" would need to be entered as `+16518675309`.
