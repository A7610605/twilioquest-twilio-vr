# Put the Keys in the Ignition

Programming challenges that use Twilio APIs require a Twilio account. [Acquire a Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio?utm_source=twilioquest-3) and locate your API credentials (called your **account SID** and **auth token**). These credentials can be found on [your Console home page](https://www.twilio.com/console).

Enter both values in the text fields on the right, and click the *HACK* button. Your credentials will be validated and stored by TwilioQuest to use in future Twilio-related challenges.
