# Three Strikes, You're OUTBOUND!

Now that you've got your Sandbox configured, it's time to write code to send an outbound WhatsApp message with Twilio. You can use your own tools to complete this task, or use the **code editor**, which has starter code for this task.

After you send an outbound message, the Twilio API will return a unique identifier for the message called a **SID**. Copy and paste this ID into the text field on the right and click *HACK* to validate your work.
