# Sandbox, stock, and barrel

The Twilio Sandbox for WhatsApp lets you start sending with WhatsApp right away, instead of waiting for WhatsApp to approve your Twilio number.

Complete [the Twilio Sandbox onboarding flow](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/whatsapp/learn). After you finish, answer the question to the right and hit the `HACK` button. We'll check your most recent messages to verify that you completed the onboarding flow for the Sandbox and are ready to continue.
