# Finding the happy media

Learn to send a WhatsApp media message (one that contains a media file) with just one added parameter to the outbound WhatsApp message code that you've already seen.

Using your own tools or the **code editor**, send an outbound WhatsApp message from your WhatsApp number (in this case, your Sandbox number) that contains an image. Paste the message `sid` into the text field on the right, and click *HACK* to claim your reward!
