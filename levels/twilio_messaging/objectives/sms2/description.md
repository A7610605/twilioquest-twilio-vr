# A Picture is Worth 1,337 Words

You've learned how to send an SMS message using the Twilio API, but now it's time to spice things up with an image. To open this chest, you'll need to send an outbound [MMS message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service) that contains a media url.

After you successfully send a media message through the API, grab the message SID and enter it into the text field on the right. When you hit *HACK*, we'll check that your message contained media, and you will be victorious!

**NOTE:** MMS messaging through the Twilio API is only available on US and Canadian phone numbers.
